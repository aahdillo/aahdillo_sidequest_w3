## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The example includes a start screen, an instructions screen, a basic game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

Click through the various screens and make your decision by clicking either the right or left side of the screen. There will be consequences based on the decision you choose. You can also gain stress depending on the choice.

## Iteration Notes

1. post-play test: there were a couple of bugs i had to fix in the code as i noticed when i ran the program nothing showed up. I had a couple of spelling mistakes or instinces where i spelt text with a capitle t. The big issue though was that I kept redefining my handleClicks() function in each file which I later found out only needed to be defined in the main.js file.
